 Analyzing Productivity in Garment Manufacturing
 
**Abstract**:
This project examines the productivity of various teams in the garment manufacturing industry, assessing performance variations between departments using ANOVA, T-tests, and correlation analysis. The impact of incentives on productivity is explored, and predictive modeling with polynomial regression is employed to provide insights for improving productivity management.

**Key Concepts**:
- **Productivity Analysis**: Evaluating actual vs. targeted productivity across teams.
- **Incentive Impact**: Assessing how incentives influence productivity.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Using polynomial regression to predict productivity.
- **Statistical Methods**: Applying ANOVA, T-tests, and correlation analysis.

**Highlights**:
1. **Dataset Description**: The dataset includes productivity statistics, incentives, and trends organized by teams, departments, and days of the week.
2. **Performance Variability**:
   - Significant differences in productivity between teams were identified using ANOVA.
   - Teams 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 12 exceeded their productivity goals, while Teams 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11 fell short.
3. **Departmental Comparison**:
   - T-tests showed that the sewing department is less productive than the finishing department, with higher SMV, overtime, and WIP.
   - Sewing tasks are more time-consuming and face more bottlenecks compared to finishing.
4. **Daily Productivity Trends**:
   - Productivity is highest on Saturdays, suggesting that rest days positively impact productivity.
5. **Incentive Analysis**:
   - The finishing department receives higher incentives, especially in Quarter 2.
   - Incentives are more stable throughout the year for the sewing department, but it remains less productive.
6. **Predictive Modeling**:
   - Polynomial regression (Degree 2) was the most effective for predicting productivity, outperforming linear regression and higher-degree models.

**Skills & Tools**:
- Statistical Analysis
- Data Visualization (Bar charts, Correlation matrices)
- Data Preprocessing and Imputation
- Python Programming
- Predictive Modeling with Polynomial Regression

**Practical Applications**:
This project provides insights into optimizing productivity in garment manufacturing. By identifying productivity variations and the impact of incentives, the study offers actionable strategies for improving efficiency and resource allocation. The findings can guide management in refining processes, redistributing resources, and designing effective incentive systems.

**Conclusion**:
The analysis highlights significant productivity differences within garment manufacturing teams and departments. Teams exceeding expectations can serve as benchmarks, while underperforming teams require process optimization. Polynomial regression proved useful for predictive modeling, identifying the most suitable degree for accurate predictions. These insights can help management adjust strategies, improve productivity, and enhance overall profitability.
