**Abstract**:
This project investigates the relationship between customer complaints and churn in the banking sector, analyzing how various demographic and financial characteristics influence customer behavior. The study aims to understand the factors driving customer exits and to provide actionable insights for improving customer retention strategies.

**Highlights**:
1. **Dataset Description**: The dataset includes customer demographics, financial activities, satisfaction indicators, complaints, and leave status.
2. **Proportion of Customers Exiting**: Analysis showed that 20% of customers exited the bank, while 80% remained.
3. **Correlation between Complaints and Exits**: A strong positive correlation (0.996) was found, indicating that complaints significantly predict churn.

   - Active Membership: Non-active members are more likely to complain.
5. **Satisfaction Scores**: No significant differences in satisfaction scores between those who stayed and those who left, suggesting satisfaction scores alone do not predict churn.

**Skills & Tools**:
- Statistical Analysis
- Data Visualization (Pie charts, Scatter plots, Heat maps, Histograms)
- Data Preprocessing and Imputation
- Python Programming

**Practical Applications**:
This project provides insights into customer behavior in the banking sector, highlighting the importance of addressing customer complaints to reduce churn. By understanding the profiles of customers who are more likely to complain and leave, banks can develop targeted strategies to improve customer satisfaction and retention.

**Conclusion**:
The study emphasizes the need for banks to focus on improving customer service and addressing complaints promptly to enhance customer loyalty. Future research should explore long-term impacts of specific service improvements and validate findings across different institutions and regions.
